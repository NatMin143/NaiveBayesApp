# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up this React + Vite project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. You can check your current Node version with:

```bash
node -v

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NatMin143/NaiveBayesApp.git
cd NaiveBayesApp
npm install

##### Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev

-------------------------------------------------------
Note: This is for running the backend server:

1. Navigate to the folder /src/assets/naivebayes/
2. Open the terminal on that folder and run the following command

python naivebayes.py

3. Open the link generated and keep it open from the browser so that the backend server can run and can be accessed from the frontend
